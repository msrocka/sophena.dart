# sophena.dart
`sophena.dart` is a Dart port of the model and core functionalities of 
[Sophena](https://github.com/GreenDelta/Sophena). It is currently used to
quickly test and develop new functions for Sophena. However, the parts that
are implemented should be fully compatible with the Sophena model. Thus, this
could be later also used in other contexts, e.g. as a starting point for a
[Flutter](https://flutter.io/) app.

## Usage

```yaml
  dependencies:
    sophena:
      git: git://github.com/msrocka/sophena.dart.git
```
